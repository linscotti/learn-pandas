The pre-commit-config.yaml is configured to work with Jupyter Notebook.

When working with .ipynb files in VSCode and using pre-commit hooks, there are a few key considerations to avoid linting errors:

Strip Output: Use tools like nbstripout to remove output from your Jupyter notebooks before committing. This helps minimize diffs and reduce file size1. You can set it up as a pre-commit hook to automatically strip output.

JSON Formatting: Ensure that your notebooks are properly formatted as JSON. Some pre-commit hooks like pretty-format-json can help with this2.

Trailing Whitespace and EOF Fixers: These hooks can sometimes fail on .ipynb files3. You might need to configure them to ignore these files or use specific tools designed for notebooks.

Linting Code Cells: Use tools like nbQA to apply standard Python linters (e.g., flake8, black) to the code cells within your notebooks. This ensures your code adheres to the same standards as your .py files.

Virtual Environment: Make sure your virtual environment is activated in VSCode to ensure all dependencies are correctly recognized.

Here's the updated .pre-commit-config.yaml configuration using ruff for linting your .ipynb files:

``á»³aml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: check-json
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: trailing-whitespace

  - repo: https://github.com/nbQA-dev/nbQA
    rev: 1.2.0
    hooks:
      - id: nbqa-ruff

  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: jupyter-nb-strip-output
        name: Strip Jupyter Notebook Output
        entry: jupyter nbconvert --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True --inplace
        language: system
        files: \.ipynb$

```

Explanation:
Check JSON: Ensures your .ipynb files are properly formatted JSON.

End-of-File Fixer: Ensures files end with a newline.

Trailing Whitespace: Removes trailing whitespace.

nbQA: Applies ruff to the code cells within your notebooks.

Strip Jupyter Notebook Output: Clears the output from your notebooks to keep diffs clean.

To use this configuration:

Save the above YAML content in a file named .pre-commit-config.yaml in your repository.

Install pre-commit if you haven't already:

bash

Copy
pip install pre-commit
Install the pre-commit hooks:

bash

Copy
pre-commit
